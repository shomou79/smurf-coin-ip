# Smurf Coin – Modular Cryptographic Protocol

## Intellectual Property Declaration

This repository contains the official intellectual property documentation for the cryptographic concept known as **"Smurf Coin"**, authored and owned by **Shorash Moustafa**.

### Summary

Smurf Coin introduces a new type of cryptographic protocol based on the concept of modular arithmetic spaces (`mod P`). Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Smurf Coin filters keys based on whether they possess modular inverses under a given modulus. This provides enhanced security, mathematical integrity, and a modular system that allows for infinite extensibility and decentralized privacy.
